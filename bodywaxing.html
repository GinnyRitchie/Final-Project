        <h2>About Body Waxing</h2>
        <p>Body waxing is where I take wax and remove unwanted hair that you do not want. This unwanted hair can be anywhere on the body for both male
            and female anatomy clients, aside from the head for male and female anatomy clients and the beard area for male anatomy clients. This is a great
            service for people who are prone to ingrowns, razor burn or want longer lasting reuslts with their hair removal.
